# HotKeys
A Hotkey binder written in C for your low level needs


There are sometimes when you know someone has done it already but you want something that can fit your idea on what it truly means to be blazingly fast. This project is supposed to save you those extra 3 seconds you need when you are looking to run a keybinder on your OS or a specific app. 

Project will be written using the WINAPI to prevent any future issues on windows.
Project will soon be written in linux as well.
